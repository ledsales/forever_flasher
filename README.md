# forever_flasher
A simple LED flasher that runs for years on a 9V battery
This simple kit uses one IC to flash a pair of LEDs at a low level using an extremely low average current.
The kit runs from 9V DC and will run continuously from a standard 9V PP3 (transistor radio) battery for years, the current consumption is so low.

Ideal for adding marker lights to equipment or for marking out paths, or anywhere else you need a low power marker light that you will never need to turn off.

We supply the kit with 4.8mm wide angle superbright white LEDs, but you can use any small LED, even two different colours if you desire.

Short form kit including PCB and all components.
Note that the main IC is a surface mount device with 1.27mm lead spacing, so you will need a fine tipped, temperature controlled soldering iron to make this kit.
